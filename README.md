# Hand and Foot

## Getting Started:
Coming soon. Stay tuned.

## Application Description:
I wanted to create a simple design/application for my first React Native project. I learned that this card game is very niche, and required an app version of handling scores and rounds. Here is the link to the official rules of the game: [Bicycle Link](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/hand-and-foot). The objective of the game is to simply get rid of your 'hand' first and then your 'foot'. However, at the end of the round, you count the types of cards you played (counting positively in your favor), along with the cards that weren't played (counting negatively against you). This application is meant to sum up and count both sets of cards so that you don't have to write down the score for everyone involved down on paper. 

Because this is a game that involves a team of 2 individuals, there is still work that is required to making the application more flexible and understanding of how that works.

## Technology Used
- React Native (Javascript)

## Icebox Items
- Make the card points more clear and visual.
- Add the rules as a hamburger option.
- Add a history of previously played games.
   - This requires user login.
- Clean up the `End Round` pop up. Needs a better design.
- Since it's a team game; Implement some form of network connection between phones. Unsure how or what that looks like. 

## Completed Tasks
- Create a 'Played' and 'Unplayed' section.
- Logic for the game.
